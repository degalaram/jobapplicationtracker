# Daily Tracker Application

## Overview

Daily Tracker is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to help users manage job searches, pending tasks, and notes in a single, mobile-first interface. The application features a clean, minimal design inspired by modern productivity tools like Notion and Linear, with support for both light and dark themes. The application uses PostgreSQL for data persistence with real-time synchronization across devices via WebSocket.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

### Design System

**Typography**
- Primary font: Inter (via Google Fonts) for readability
- Font weights: 400 (normal), 500 (medium), 600 (semibold)
- Responsive text sizing: `text-sm` for mobile, `text-base` for desktop

**Color System**
Semantic color tokens defined in CSS variables:
- Light mode: Professional blue primary (219 85% 35%), near-white backgrounds
- Dark mode: Lighter blue primary (219 85% 55%), dark gray backgrounds
- Separate color definitions for cards, popovers, and sidebar components
- Border colors and elevation states for interactive elements

**Component Patterns**
- Cards for content grouping with consistent border and shadow styles
- Buttons with multiple variants: default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost
- Form inputs with consistent height (h-9) and styling
- Badge components for status indicators
- Dialog/modal patterns for user interactions

**Layout System**
- Tailwind spacing units (2, 4, 6, 8) for consistent spacing
- Responsive breakpoints following Tailwind defaults
- Flexbox and Grid for layout patterns
- Mobile-first responsive design approach
