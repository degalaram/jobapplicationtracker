# Daily Tracker - Environment Variables Configuration

# =============================================================================
# GMAIL CONFIGURATION (Required for OTP Email Delivery)
# =============================================================================
# OTPs are sent ONLY via email. Console logging has been completely removed.
# You MUST configure these Gmail settings for the application to work correctly.

# Your Gmail email address
GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com

# Gmail App Password (NOT your regular Gmail password)
# Follow these steps to generate an App Password:
# 
# 1. Enable 2-Step Verification on your Google Account:
#    https://myaccount.google.com/security
#
# 2. Generate an App Password:
#    https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
#    - Select "Mail" as the app
#    - Select your device type
#    - Google will generate a 16-character password
#
# 3. Copy the generated password (remove spaces) and paste it below
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-16-character-app-password

# =============================================================================
# ENVIRONMENT SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
# =============================================================================

# FOR REPLIT:
# 1. Open "Secrets" tab (lock icon in left sidebar)
# 2. Add two secrets:
#    - Key: GMAIL_USER, Value: your-email@gmail.com
#    - Key: GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD, Value: your-app-password
# 3. Restart the application

# FOR VS CODE / LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
# 1. Copy this file to .env (without .example)
# 2. Replace the values above with your actual Gmail credentials
# 3. Make sure .env is in .gitignore (it already is)
# 4. Restart the application

# FOR OTHER ENVIRONMENTS:
# Set GMAIL_USER and GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD as environment variables
# using your platform's configuration system

# =============================================================================
# DATABASE CONFIGURATION (Optional - uses in-memory storage as fallback)
# =============================================================================
# DATABASE_URL=your-postgres-connection-string

# =============================================================================
# SESSION CONFIGURATION (Optional - has defaults)
# =============================================================================
# SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-here

# =============================================================================
# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES
# =============================================================================
# 1. NEVER commit .env file to git (it's in .gitignore)
# 2. NEVER share your App Password with anyone
# 3. If you suspect your App Password is compromised, revoke it immediately:
#    https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# 4. OTPs are NEVER logged to console - they are only sent via email
# 5. If email sending fails, you'll see an error message in the application

# =============================================================================
# TROUBLESHOOTING
# =============================================================================
# If you see "Failed to send OTP email" error:
# 
# 1. Check that GMAIL_USER and GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD are correctly set
# 2. Verify 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Google account
# 3. Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular password
# 4. Check that your App Password hasn't expired or been revoked
# 5. Ensure your internet connection is working
# 6. Try generating a new App Password if the current one doesn't work
